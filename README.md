**Food Ordering Application**

**Project description**

This project includes many features which allow a user to order food, search for restaurants, select their desired food and order that. Users will have to go for certain options before ordering which will include confirmation of order, selecting payment method such as cash on delivery or payment through bank account. The user will then add the location to which order should be delivered. A time will be given to the user by the application depending on the order and its preparation time.  After that time, the order will be delivered to the address given by the user. Then the user will be asked to give rating to the restaurant depending on the quality of food and delivery time.

**Problems and Solutions:** It's increasingly common for people to crave outside food all day. Sometimes, they'd rather order food than cook at home. For this reason, this application will give them ease to order. All they need is an internet connection and a device. This application will provide them with several series of restaurants and a variety of food irrespective of the area. The other problem which people are facing now a days is joblessness. Many people are jobless now a days due to less job opportunities. This application will give them a choice to become a rider and serve people by delivering their orders to their locations. This app will help them to earn some amount and will provide them a means to improve their financial situation.

**Goals:** This application aims to facilitate individuals in ordering food from various restaurants and having it delivered to their preferred locations. It will act as a crucial support system for those facing unemployment, providing job opportunities for individuals to sustain their livelihoods and reduce some of the challenges they encounter in their daily lives. 

**Features to be implemented in future:** New enhancements will be introduced to this application through upcoming updates. One of these updates will incorporate a feature for grocery shopping. Furthermore, an update like monthly lucky draw will also be introduced to the app. To participate in the lucky draw, users will need to place a food order of at least 5K. Winners will receive coupons based on the prevailing conditions at that time.

**Installation:** Its installation will be very easy. It will guide us through the setup steps and then proceed to install smoothly.

**Run The Project:** After installing itâ€™s exe file, it will be just one click to open the application.

**How to Use:** This application offers a user-friendly experience. Upon opening, users will first encounter the logo and then be prompted to choose between joining as a professional or as a customer. Following this, users will need to either log in or sign up for an account. If joining as a professional, users will gain access to a dashboard featuring options such as order management, earnings tracking, and order completion status. Alternatively, if joining as a customer, users will navigate through various restaurants via a search bar on an open page, with additional features like ordered food tracking, delivery status, and reward points. Once selecting a restaurant, users will proceed to choose items from the menu, adding them to the cart. Subsequently, users will review the cart before confirming the order. Payment options include bank transfer or cash on delivery. Users will then confirm the delivery address, and the application will provide an estimated delivery time. Following delivery, users will be prompted to rate and review both the food quality and the app's service.
